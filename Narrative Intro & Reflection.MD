Narrative Intro & Reflection

  For my visual argument I wanted to focus on the concept of nostalgia and how things from the past hold their value in todayâ€™s world. Nostalgia is something that everyone has experience with throughout their lives, it connects us to our memories and emotions when looking at certain objects, media, and places. My goal for this project is to create an image that gets the audience to feel a sense of nostalgia and to think about how the aesthetics of the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s shape our culture today. These different eras have a lot of popularity in our world and have impacted our culture in many ways. I used images and items that reference what was popular in each decade to really emphasize that feeling of nostalgia. 
  I knew I wanted to create something that gave off the impression that these objects were in a vortex or going through a portal to show off the idea that these old items from the past are still relevant today. The background image at first was a yellow and red color, however it clashed with a lot of the objects and so I adjusted the saturation and hue in order to get the purple color you see in the final image to create a nice contrast between them. The next thing I aimed at doing in the visual argument was creating a sense of movement since I wanted the create that feeling of them moving through a time portal. I did this through the alignment of each object so that it flowed into the black hole and making sure each element had motion blur and video degradation. Overall, I am satisfied with how my Visual Argument came out and believe that it achieved my main goal in creating a sense of nostalgia and how old aesthetics come back into relevance.
